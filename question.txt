Write a PL/SQL block which will populate the RESULTS table as described below.
Consider performance implications (specifically where would you commit the queries) as we are dealing with millions of records. This query is suppose to cater for large volumes of data. 

The PL/SQL must:

- insert into the RESULTS table each customer id, and the number of unique products purchased by that customer.
- update the recently_purchased column of the customer table to 'Y' (yes if they have purchased a product in the last 12 months) or 'N' (if they have not purchased a product in the last 12 months).

Listed below are the tables & definitions:

table: CUSTOMER
columns: customer_id NUMBER, customer_name VARCHAR2(100), recently_purchased VARCHAR2(1) -- 'Y' or 'N'

table: CUST_PRODUCTS
columns: product_id NUMBER, customer_id NUMBER, date_purchased DATE

table: RESULTS
columns: customer_id NUMBER, product_count NUMBER

table: PRODUCTS
column: product_id NUMBER, product_name VARCHAR2(100)
